"I am keyless, even though I have a key in my pocket. This key leads to an adventure! 
Where does it go? 
Doors, cars, hearts, journals and treasure boxes." -S1n-Llaves

My cyber-security interest in 2017 after watching Mr. Robot. A friend said not to do any of that or I'll get caught and go to jail. He pointed me to some resources and an obsession started. After that summer I landed a internship, got hired, and trained in Teir 3/4 network access control and poly-vendor integration solutions crafted to harden and monitor systems and assets. 

After that super difficult architect tooling and writing actionable policy sets, I got a chance to get back to my initial desire. Mixed with my 9 years of psychology and the power of a keyboard I am becoming a defender of theft, abuse, and fraud.

This blog will detail many of my learnings and crafts.

I intend to use the power of Adversial / Offensive Security Engineering and Hacker Ingenuity for good. I hope you do too. Stay secure ;)
