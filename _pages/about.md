I began my cyber-security interest in 2017 after watching Mr. Robot. A friend said not to do any of that or I'll get caught and go to jail. He pointed me to some resources and an obsession started. After that summer I landed a internship, trained in T3/4 network access control and poly-vendor integration solutions crafted to harden and monitor systems and assets. After that super difficult architect tooling and writing actionable policy sets, I got a chance to get back to my initial desire. Mixed with my 9 years of psychology and the power of a keyboard I am becoming a defender of theft, abuse, and fraud. Your better off hiring people like me to save your assets before someone takes them. 

This blog will detail many of my learnings and crafts.

I intend to use the power of Adversial / Offensive Security Engineering and Hacker Ingenuity for good.
